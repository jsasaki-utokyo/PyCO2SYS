!!! example "Try out PyCO2SYS v2!"
    PyCO2SYS v2 is currently in beta testing.  The v2 docs and installation instructions are at [mvdh.xyz/PyCO2SYS](https://mvdh.xyz/PyCO2SYS/).  For now, installing via `pip` or `conda` still gets you v1.8.3, matching the docs here ([PyCO2SYS.readthedocs.io](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

    Please try v2 out and report any issues you encounter via [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS/issues)!
    
    The API has been kept as similar as possible to v1, but there are some breaking changes.  The v2 code runs significantly faster with lower memory overhead and is designed to be more intuitive to use.

# PyCO2SYS

PyCO2SYS is a Python toolbox for solving the marine carbonate system and calculating related seawater properties.  Its core is a Python implementation of CO2SYS for MATLAB[^1].

## Installation

### With pip

Install from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/PyCO2SYS/):

    pip install PyCO2SYS

Update an existing installation:

    pip install PyCO2SYS --upgrade --no-cache-dir

### With conda/mamba

Install from the [conda-forge channel](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyco2sys):

    conda install PyCO2SYS -c conda-forge

## Basic use

The import convention for PyCO2SYS is:

```python
import PyCO2SYS as pyco2
```

and the only function you need is:

```python
results = pyco2.sys(**kwargs)
```

Read [How to use PyCO2SYS](co2sys_nd) for more on `pyco2.sys`, its `kwargs` and its `results`.


### Examples

You can see some working examples of PyCO2SYS in action on Github at [PyCO2SYS-examples](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples).  You can run all of the notebooks there live in your browser [via Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples/master), without installing anything on your computer.

Adding your notebooks showcasing PyCO2SYS to [PyCO2SYS-examples](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples) is welcomed!

## About

PyCO2SYS is maintained primarily by [Dr Matthew Humphreys](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/matthew-humphreys) of NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (Texel) with support from the main developers of all previous versions of CO2SYS.

The DOI above refers to all versions of PyCO2SYS.  Please specify which version of PyCO2SYS you used.  You can find the version number that you are using in Python with:

```python
import PyCO2SYS as pyco2
pyco2.hello()
```

You should also consider citing the original work by [Lewis and Wallace (1998)](refs/#l), and specify which [optional sets of constants](co2sys_nd/#settings) you used in your calculations.

### History

The original CO2SYS program for DOS was created by Ernie Lewis and Doug Wallace ([LW98](refs/#l)).  This was translated into MATLAB by Denis Pierrot and subsequently optimised by Steven van Heuven ([HPR11](refs/#h)).  Jim Orr and co-authors added further sets of equilibrium constants and implemented error propagation in a separate program ([OEDG18](refs/#o)).  The latest MATLAB version was translated into Python as PyCO2SYS by Matthew Humphreys, benefitting enormously from all this previous work.  Further (ongoing) modifications and additions to the PyCO2SYS code and documentation have been made by Matthew Humphreys, Luke Gregor, Daniel Sandborn and Abigail Schiller ([HSS21](refs/#h)).
